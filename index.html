    <p>Gold is one of my favorite colors because of how shiny it is. There is just something about the way gold has such a luster to it no matter what you put it on. Gold is also aesthetically pleasing to look at in general.<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiqupm35Y_dAhWG7FMKHZT-BUYQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.publicdomainpictures.net%2Fen%2Fview-image.php%3Fimage%3D41974%26picture%3Ddark-red-gradient-frame&psig=AOvVaw1W0dMBgCZK74kMuMFQ0-7s&ust=1535547253821405">Dark Red</a> is one of my favorite colors because one, I'm a Leo, and two, I love the fiery nature of it. I love all shades of red, dark red, bright red, orange red, any type of red, but my favorite of them all would have to be dark red. The dark, smooth nature of the color is just so magnificent that I can't take my eyes off it.Olive Green would have to be the third of my favorite colors list because I recently just started liking it. I like a specific olive green though. The pastel olive green is the most beautiful color ever. It's so calming to look at and brightens up any aspect in a room, painting or decor.</p>
