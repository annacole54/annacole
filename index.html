<h1>Do Now</h1>
<p>Phishing-the fraudulent practice of sending emails purporting to be from reputable companies to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.

Flaming- hostile and insulting interaction between persons over the internet, often involving the use of profanity. It can also be the swapping of insults back and forth or with many people teaming up on a single victim.

Spamming-send the same message indiscriminately to (large numbers of recipients) on the Internet.



Each term involves two parties reaching out to each other. Phishing and Spamming are more like each other than flaming is. Flaming is just people attacking each other with insults and being mean. Phishing is like the scammers who will call you telling you youâ€™re late on taxes and owe the irs. Spamming is the most annoying as companies would continuously send you emails or messages saying the same thing. Phishing and spamming are alike in the sense that they are both trying to get a person to do something, whether it be to check out something or give the company your bank info. All the terms are alike in the sense that they are all online and very often in the real world.  </p>
